# Introduction

Welcome all to this beginner-friendly micro crio-byte that will get started you off in Data Structures and Algorithms in your favorite programming language!! 

Across all domains of programming we come across data strucutres and algorithms(DSA). A peek into some [practical computer science application](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1539069/practical-uses-of-different-data-structures). Today all companies especially FAANG focuses on DSA aspects; [why](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1539069/practical-uses-of-different-data-structures)? Every service, command we use is faciltated by some logic which is written using DSA.

Be it competitive programming or software development or artificial intelligence or cloud computing, Data Structures and Algorithms is the tool that will help you stand out of the crowd.

# Background

A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. And, an algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.

A nightmare to some but a lightsaber of coders, this is the intellectual analytical implementation a programmer needs to have make the program's functionality most [efficient](https://cs.stackexchange.com/questions/71858/definition-of-efficiency-versus-complexity-of-algorithm).

Awesome if you are at this point already!!
Now check the following referenes to get an idea of algorithms which you have to implement now using the before learnt data structures and the ones you will be learning aheadðŸ˜€

For creators,

There are numerous algorithms. Start off with your favorite one and try and find best of the best implementations of that algorithm and keep pulling PRs along the way.

For learners,
Keep following the resources and keep diging on your own too and try and understand code of the creators and find bugs to earn the community's respectðŸ˜„
