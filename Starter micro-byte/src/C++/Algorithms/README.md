# Searching Algorithms

Searching Algorithms are designed to check for an element or retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored.

This the most basic yet an essential category of all algorithms and the right one to kick off your DSA.

For binary search and divide and conquer [refer](https://www.codechef.com/LRNDSA04?order=desc&sortBy=successful_submissions).

Keep expanding the scope of all algorithms within searching algorithm.
